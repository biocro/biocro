\title{Champaign, IL weather data}

\description{
  Champaign, IL weather data specified at hourly intervals in the CST time zone
  for the years 1995--2023. The data includes typical inputs required for BioCro
  imulations. Note: some values are missing near the start of 1995 since those
  time points are not available from SURFRAD.

  This weather data is included in the BioCro package so users can reproduce
  the calculations of Lochocki \emph{et al.} (2022)
  [\doi{10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003}] and for exploratory purposes; it is
  likely that most BioCro studies will require different data sets, and no
  attempt is made here to be exhaustive.

\usage{weather}

\format{
  A list of 29 named elements, where each element is a data frame corresponding
  to one year of weather data and the name of each element is a year, for
  example \code{'2004'}. Each data frame has 8760 or 8784 observations
  (representing hourly time points) of 9 variables:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{year}: the year
    \item \code{doy}: the day of year
    \item \code{hour}: the hour
    \item \code{time_zone_offset}: the time zone offset relative to UTC (hr)
    \item \code{precip}: preciptation rate (mm / hr)
    \item \code{rh}: the ambient relative humidity (dimensionless)
    \item \code{solar}: the incoming photosynthetically active photon flux
          density (PPFD) measured on a ground area basis including direct and
          diffuse sunlight light just outside the crop canopy
          (micromol / m^2 / s)
    \item \code{temp}: the ambient air temperature (degrees Celsius)
    \item \code{windspeed}: the wind speed in the ambient air just outside the
          canopy (m / s)
  }

  Weather data were obtained from the public SURFRAD and WARM databases and
  processed according to the method described in Lochocki \emph{et al.} (2022)
  [\doi{10.1093/insilicoplants/diac003}]. See version 1.2.0 of the
  \code{eloch216/oscillator-based-circadian-clock-analysis}
  \href{https://github.com/eloch216/oscillator-based-circadian-clock-analysis}{GitHub repository}
  for a full description of the data processing.

  In brief, the columns in the data frames were determined from SURFRAD and WARM
  variables as follows:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{precip}: from the \code{precip} variable in the WARM data set
    \item \code{rh}: from the \code{rh} variable in the SURFRAD data set
    \item \code{solar}: from the \code{par} variable in the SURFRAD data set;
          when these values are not available, the \code{direct_n},
          \code{diffuse}, and \code{zen} variables are used to make an estimate
    \item \code{temp}: from the \code{temp} variable in the SURFRAD data set
    \item \code{windspeed}: from the \code{windspd} variable in the SURFRAD data
          set
  }

  The WARM data set includes daily values. Hourly values for precipitation are
  derived from daily totals by assuming a constant rate of precipitation
  throughout the day.

  The SURFRAD data set includes values at 1 or 3 minute intervals. Hourly values
  are determined by averaging over hourly intervals, where the value at hour
  \code{h} is the average over the hour-long interval centered at \code{h}. Some
  values are missing; any missing entries are filled via an interpolation
  procedure based on the assumption that values at the same hour of sequential
  days should be similar.

  The \code{time_zone_offset} is set to a constant value of -6 since this data
  is specified in the CST time zone (i.e., UTC-6). Since the value of this
  quantity does not change, it could in principle be considered a parameter
  rather than a driver; however, it is included with the weather data for
  convenience.

  To reduce size the in the BioCro repository, the raw data is rounded to three
  significant digits. This can be done with the following code: \code{
  weather <- lapply(raw_weather, function(wd) { for (cn in colnames(wd)) { wd[[cn]] <- signif(wd[[cn]], digits = 3) }; wd })
  }
}
