## Note: The rules here are mainly rules that should apply to
## particular file names at all levels (e.g. .DS_Store, .RData, *.swp)
## and those concerning files in "canonical" R package directories
## (e.g., in src, vignettes, or inst/doc).  Many of the other "ignore"
## rules have been moved to .gitignore files in the subdirectories
## they most directly pertain to.  One advantage of this is that if
## those directories should happen to be renamed, the rules pertaining
## to them need not be revised.
