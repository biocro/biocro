[^note_ghostscript]: _Ghostscript_ is used to convert the PostScript
files that are generated for formulas in the documentation into
bitmaps.  But _MathJax_ provides an alternative method of rendering
formulas in the HTML documentation, and so Ghostscript is unneeded as
long as the Doxygen configuration variable `USE_MATHJAX` is set to
`YES`.  This is the BioCro default setting.

    If Ghostscript _is_ used, there may be some compatibility issues
between Ghostscript and Doxygen.  If you encounter problems, see
[Doxygen issue
#7290](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/7290){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} and [Doxygen issue
#8107](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/8107){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} for further information.

    On the other hand, use of _MathJax_ requires a working internet
connection, at least until your browser downloads and caches the
_MathJax_ code file.  And it requires that JavaScript be enabled.

[^note_make_version]: Although versions earlier than 4.3 will probably
mostly work, you will get a warning when you use them.

[^note_gmake]: Some users will have to type `gmake` in place of `make`
to get the latest version of Gnu Make.  Type `make --version` or
`gmake --version` to see exactly what version you are calling.

[^always_make_option]: If you are compiling the documentation using
_Make_ and haven't changed any source files since last running it, add
the `-B` option to force recompilation.

[^custom_input]: Alternatively, if you will be working extensively
with one particular file, you could temporarily add

    ```
    INPUT=../src/module_library/partitioning_coefficient_logistic.h
    ```

    to the customization file (`doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile`).
    Then you would simply run

    ```
    doxygen
    ```

    from the `doxygen` directory.

    Note that even though the customization file is in the
    `doxygen/customizations` directory, _the file paths listed in the
    `INPUT` value should be relative to the `doxygen` directory!_

[^color_settings]: Other settings that affect the color of the
documentation are HTML_COLORSTYLE, HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT, and
HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA.  The values for these options must be set
in the customization file `doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile` if using
_Make_; alternately, if calling `doxygen` directly, they may be set on
the command line; for example

        (cat Doxyfile; echo "HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT=255") | doxygen -

      See the [Configuration section] of the Doxygen documentation for
      information about these settings.

<!-- main text -->

To generate documentation for the C/C++ code, we use
[_Doxygen_][Doxygen].

### Use cases for generating the Doxygen documentation {#sec:use-cases}

As mentioned in Section \@ref(sec:when-to-generate-docs), developers
should rarely need to generate documentation themselves since all of
the documentation is regularly generated and published on-line.  But
there are cases where it makes sense to "do it yourself."  For
Doxygen, these include:

#. You are altering the code or documentation of a particular C++
   source file, and you want to check that changes you make show up
   correctly in the generated documentation.

#. You want a local copy of the Doxygen documentation because you
   don't want to rely upon always having an internet connection.

#. You are making large-scale changes to the code, and it would be
   useful to have a version of the documentation that tracks with your
   changes.

#. You prefer a different presentation style for the documentation
   than is used in the on-line version.

Use Cases 2 and 3 are best addressed using the simple methods of
Section \@ref(sec:running-doxygen).  Use Case 1 is greatly facilitated
by speeding up Doxygen using the methods discussed in Section
\@ref(sec:speeding-up-doxygen).  Lastly, Use Case 4, which requires a
more extensive knowledge of Doxygen, is discussed in Section
\@ref(sec:customizing-doxygen).

**If none of these use cases apply to you, you most likely can simply
use the [on-line documentation][on-line version] (follow the _C++
Library_ menu-bar link) and skip the rest of this chapter.**

### Required software

- Doxygen (version 1.9.2 or higher)

- The Graph visualization toolkit ("GraphViz"; version 2.38 or higher)

  You can get by without this if you don't care about generating the
  dependency and inheritance graphs.  _If you don't have GraphViz
  installed, set "HAVE_DOT = NO" in the customization file (see
  below)._

- A LaTeX distribution

  This is needed only if you set `USE_MATHJAX = NO`, or if you want
  to generate the PDF version of the documentation.

- Ghostscript

  You may be able to get by without this.  You _will_ need it,
  however, if you wish to generate HTML documentation that doesn't
  rely on MathJAX.[^note_ghostscript]

- Gnu Make (version 4.3 or higher)[^note_make_version]

  This is needed only if you want to take advantage of the Makefile
  recipes.

### Installation

Binary distributions of Doxygen for Linux x86-64, for Windows (Vista
and later), and for macOS (10.14 and later) are available on the
[Doxygen Downloads page].  To compile Doxygen from source, see the
[Doxygen Installation page].

If you use a package manager, installation is quite easy.  For
example, running

```
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz ghostscript
```

on Ubuntu will get you not only Doxygen, but
Ghostscript and the Graph visualization toolkit as
well.  (To do something similar on a Mac with Homebrew, run `brew
install doxygen graphviz ghostscript`.)

Depending on your system setup and operating system, you may
additionally need to take pains to ensure that all required
tools---`gs`, `make`, `dot` (from Graphviz), and `doxygen`
itself---are on your system path.

### Generating the Documentation {#sec:running-doxygen}

#### If you have _Make_ installed {-}

By far the easiest way to generate the complete Doxygen documentation
with more or less the same customizations as appear in the [on-line
version] is to open a terminal to the `doxygen` directory and run

```
make all-html
```

(Since `all-html` is the default Make target, you can also simply type
`make`.)  This will generate the most complete HTML version of the
Doxygen documentation.[^note_gmake] To view it, open your browser to
the landing page for the documentation, located at
`doxygen/doxygen_docs_complete/html/index.html`.  (On many systems,
typing

```
make view
```

will generate the documentation and open it in a browser in a single
step.)


There are other _Make_ targets available.  To see a list, run

```
make help
```

These other _Make_ targets may be useful if you want a PDF version of
the documentation; or if you want to concentrate on the documentation
of the BioCro modules only, or conversely, on only the C++ BioCro
_framework_.

#### If you don't have _Make_ installed {-}

Doxygen can be run directly by simply opening a terminal to the
`doxygen` directory and typing

```
doxygen
```

on the command line.  This produces _almost_ the same results as
running `make`.  The differences are

* The browser won't automatically open the documentation, as it does
  when you run `make view`.

* The _About_ page won't show information from Git about the state
  your working copy of the BioCro repository was in at the time you
  generated the documentation.

* The location of the generated documentation's landing page will be
  `doxygen/html/index.html` rather than
  `doxygen/doxygen_docs_complete/html/index.html`.

* The canned Doxygen customization sets provided by `Makefile` are not
  available when you run `doxygen` directoy.

### Speeding up Doxygen {#sec:speeding-up-doxygen}

#### Method 1 {-}

By far, the most time consuming part of generating the Doxygen
documentation is creating the graphs showing relationships between
program components.  You can speed up Doxygen tremendously by
disabling the generation of these graphs.  **This is particularly
recommended if you are tweaking the documentation of some source code
and want to quickly see how your changes affect the rendered
documentation** (see the first use case in Section
\@ref(sec:use-cases)).

To disable generation of graphs:

#. Create a file called `Doxyfile` in the directory
`doxygen/customizations`.

#. Insert the single line `HAVE_DOT = NO` into this file.

(If `doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile` already exists, simply add the
line `HAVE_DOT = NO` to it.)

Doing these two steps will override the setting `HAVE_DOT = YES`
contained in `doxygen/Doxyfile`.

(Bash shell users can disable graph generation for a single call of
`doxygen` by running the command

```
(cat Doxyfile; echo "HAVE_DOT = NO") | doxygen -
```

in the `doxygen` directory.  If you use a different shell, see the
question [_Can I configure doxygen from the command
line?_][doxygen_faq] in the Doxygen FAQ.)

Once you are satisfied with the way your Doxygen comments are
rendered, you can, if you like, generate the documentation _with_ the
graphs by removing the `HAVE_DOT = NO` line from
`doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile`.[^always_make_option]

#### Method 2 {-}

Another way to speed up Doxygen is to run it only on the particular
file whose documentation you are tweaking.  For example, if you are
adding to or changing the documentation in the source file

```
src/module_library/partitioning_coefficient_logistic.h
```

you can simply run

```
(cat Doxyfile; echo "INPUT=../src/module_library/partitioning_coefficient_logistic.h") | doxygen -
```

in a Bash shell from the `doxygen` directory.[^custom_input] This will
run almost instantaneously!

(The down side is that you will only be able to view the documentation
pertaining to that particular file.  You won't, for example, be able
to click on links to parent classes or dependent files and see the
related documentation of those program entities.)


### Doxygen for power users: Customizing Doxygen builds {#sec:customizing-doxygen}

This section addresses Use Case 4 of Section \@ref(sec:use-cases).

As we saw in Section \@ref(sec:speeding-up-doxygen), we can customize
Doxygen runs by adding settings to the file
`doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile`.  For example, adding `HAVE_DOT =
NO` to this file will override the setting `HAVE_DOT = YES` contained
in `doxygen/Doxyfile`.

Doxygen offers dozens of settings that allow one to customize the
generated documentation according to one's preferences.  We will
highlight just a few of these settings that may be of special
interest.  For a complete list, see the [Configuration section] of the
Doxygen documentation.

INPUT

: We saw this setting in Section \@ref(sec:speeding-up-doxygen), where
  we used it to override the default setting (which looks at _all_ of
  the C++ source files) in order to concentrate on a particular file.
  This vastly reduced Doxygen's running time.

    Note that multiple files (_or directories!_) may be listed here:
    simply separate the names with a space.  Alternatively, list each on
    a separate line, using `INPUT +=` on all but the first line.  For
    example,

    ```
    INPUT  = ../src/module_library/partitioning_coefficient_logistic.h
    INPUT += ../src/framework
    ```

    will yield documentation of the `partitioning_coefficient_logistic`
    module plus documentation of all of the source files in the
    `src/framework` directory.

    **Note that the Make-file recipes ignore settings made to `INPUT`
    in the Doxyfiles.** You will have to call `doxygen` directly for
    these settings to have any effect.

    Note also that Doxygen does not automatically recurse into
    subdirectories.  For example, to also document the contents of
    `src/framework/utils`, you would need to add a third line:

    ```
    INPUT += ../src/framework/utils
    ```

GENERATE_TREEVIEW

: The setting in `doxygen/Doxyfile` is `YES`.  Since the Tree View
    index takes up screen width, setting this value to `NO` may
    facilitate easier browsing of source code.

    As with `INPUT`, the Make-file recipes normally override any setting
    made to this variable in the Doxyfiles.  For this variable however,
    the value may be overridden on the command line using a call to
    _Make_ of the form


      ```
      make generate_treeview=NO <make target>
      ```

      (see the note below).  Or, simply call `doxygen` directly as in
      the `INPUT` case.

HAVE_DOT

: As we saw in the previous section, setting this to NO will vastly
    reduce compilation time.  _(You should also set this to NO if you
    don't have a copy of GraphViz, the package that contains the
    **dot** tool!)_ Unlike with `INPUT` and `GENERATE_TREEVIEW`,
    _Make_ **does** respect the value this is set to in the Doxyfiles.

    For finer-grained control over which diagrams get generated, see
    the Doxygen documentation section [Configuration options related
    to the dot tool].

The `doxygen/customizations` directory contains a sample customization
file named `Doxyfile_customization_sample` containing some suggestions
for customizing your own Doxygen builds.  To use this as a template,
copy it to a file named `Doxyfile` (in the same directory) and modify
it as you see fit.

#### Note on customizing _Make_ builds {-}

Certain customization variables are off limits when building the
documentation using _Make_.  These include the following:
`GENERATE_HTML`, `GENERATE_TREEVIEW`, `GENERATE_LATEX`, `INPUT`,
`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, `EXTRACT_PRIVATE`, and `HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE`.

If any of these tags are set in the customization file
`doxygen/customizations/Doxyfile`, those settings will be ignored when
using _Make_.  This is because the _Make_ file itself sets values for
these variables, overriding any settings in the Doxyfiles.

Three of these variables, however, _can_ be set on the _command line_
when running _Make_.  This is done as follows:

GENERATE_TREEVIEW

: To override the value YES that is set in `Makefile`, add a variable
    setting to the `make` command:

    ```
    make generate_treeview=NO <make target>
    ```

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE

: To override the value 143 that is set in `Makefile`, add a variable
    setting to the `make` command.  For example

    ```
    make color=30 <make target>
    ```

    For the meaning of the _hue_ number, see the [Wikipedia article on
    this subject][hue numbers].[^color_settings]

EXTRACT_PRIVATE

: To override the value YES that is set in `Makefile``, add a variable
    setting to the `make` command:

    ```
    make extract_private=NO <make target>
    ```

    This will produce documentation that focuses on the public API for
    classes, omitting documentation of private class members.
