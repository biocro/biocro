# A General Canopy Photosynthesis Model {#general}

At the leaf level, the net CO$_2$ assimilation rate per unit leaf area
($A_{n,leaf}$) depends on the incident photosynthetically active photon flux
density (PPFD; $Q_{in}$), the absorbed shortwave energy ($I_{abs}$), the ambient
CO$_2$ concentration outside the boundary layer ($C_a$), the air temperature
($T_a$), the relative humidity ($h_a$), and several other environmental factors.
Mathematically, we can express this by writing $A_n$ as a function of these
variables: $A_{n,leaf} = A_{n,leaf}(Q_{in}, I_{abs}, C_a, T_a, h_a)$. The exact
equation used to calculate $A_{n,leaf}$ will generally depend on individual
choices for modelling photosynthetic biochemistry, stomatal response, and energy
balance. For simplicity, we do not attempt to reproduce them here.

Each of these environmental variables may change throughout a crop canopy. A
common way to treat this is to express each of them as a function of the
cumulative leaf area index (cLAI; $\ell$). At the top of the canopy, $\ell = 0$,
and it increases to $\ell = L$ at the bottom of the canopy, where $L$ is the
whole-canopy leaf area index (LAI). LAI itself is defined as the one-sided leaf
area per unit ground area. It can be loosely interpreted as the number of leaf
layers covering the ground. cLAI can then be interpreted as the LAI of leaves
above a certain point in the canopy.

For a wide area of a crop that has achieved canopy closure, lateral position
within the field is not expected to influence environmental conditions, leaving
depth within the canopy as the main variable. Cumulative LAI is a way to express
depth within the canopy using leaf area, since the amount of leaf area above a
particular point is more important for determining $Q_{in}$ (and the other
variables) than the physical distance below the canopy top.

With this in mind, we can write $A_{n,leaf} = A_{n,leaf}(Q_{in}(\ell),
I_{abs}(\ell), C_a(\ell), T_a(\ell), h_a(\ell))$. This notation is a bit
unweildy, and it can be made more compact by writing $A_{n,leaf} =
A_{n,leaf}(\ell)$. In this form, it is implied that each of the inputs to the
photosynthesis model used to calculate $A_{n,leaf}$ change with $\ell$. This
notation is convenient because it allows us to define the net CO$_2$
assimilation rate per unit ground area ($A_{n,canopy}$) using a one-dimensional
integral over $\ell$:

\begin{equation}
    A_{n,canopy} = \int_{\ell = 0}^{L} A_{n,leaf}(\ell) d \ell,
    (\#eq:AnCanopy)
\end{equation}

where $A_{n,leaf}(\ell)$ is the net CO$_2$ assimilation rate (per leaf area) of
an infinitesimally small piece of leaf located at cLAI $\ell$, and $d \ell$ is
the cLAI associated with that piece. ($d \ell$ can be thought of as $L \cdot dS
/ S$, where $dS$ is the area of the piece of leaf and $S$ is the total leaf
area of the canopy.)

Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopy) is the most general way to express the relationship
between leaf-level and canopy photosynthesis. From a biological point of view,
it is equivalent to dividing the canopy into infinitely many layers, each of
which is infinitesimally thin and contains an infinitesimally small amount of
leaf area, and then adding the contribution of each thin layer together to get
the whole canopy rate. The function $A_{n,leaf}(\ell)$ represents the rate from
such an infinitesimally thin leaf layer.

## Examples

A canopy photosynthesis model is discussed in @thornley_plant_1990 (see the
section [below](#thornley)). Although Thornley uses different notation and a
simplistic model for photosynthesis, it is clear that his Equations 10.4a and
10.1b can be combined to express canopy photosynthesis ($P$) in a similar way to
our Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopy):

\begin{equation}
    P = \int_0^L P_1(l) dl.
\end{equation}

Other examples can be found in journal articles, such as Equation 10 from
@hirose_maximizing_1987. When a simple model of photosynthesis is used,
sometimes $A_{n,leaf}(\ell)$ is explicitly written, as in Table I from
@goudriaan_simple_1986.

# A Model with Shaded and Sunlit Leaves

Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopy) is an oversimplified way to represent $A_{n,canopy}$
because it ignores several other key variables that influence $A_{n,leaf}$
besides $\ell$. A common refinement of this model is to separately consider
sunlit and shaded leaves. A major difference between these two leaf classes is
the dependence of $Q_{in}$ on $\ell$. Sunlit leaves at any depth within the
canopy all receive a very similar value of $Q_{in}$, while shaded leaves
generally receive less light deeper within the canopy. When sunlit and shaded
leaves are treated separately, we can write

\begin{equation}
    A_{n,leaf}(\ell) = A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}(\ell) \cdot f_{sunlit}(\ell) +
        A_{n,leaf}^{shaded}(\ell) \cdot f_{shaded}(\ell),
\end{equation}

where $A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}(\ell)$ and $A_{n,leaf}^{shaded}(\ell)$ are the
leaf-level net CO$_2$ assimilation rates per leaf area for sunlit and shaded
leaves at cLAI $\ell$, and $f_{sunlit}(\ell)$ and $f_{shaded}(\ell)$ are the
fractions of sunlit and shaded leaf area at $\ell$. (All leaves must be either
sunlit or shaded, so $f_{sunlit}(\ell) + f_{shaded}(\ell) = 1$.) With this new
expression for leaf-level photosynthesis, Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopy) can be
modified to

\begin{equation}
    A_{n,canopy} = \int_{\ell = 0}^{L} \left[
        A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}(\ell)f_{sunlit}(\ell) +
            A_{n,leaf}^{shaded}(\ell)f_{shaded}(\ell) \right] d \ell.
    (\#eq:AnCanopyRefined)
\end{equation}

## Examples

See, for example, Equation 18 from @sellers_canopy_1985 or Equation 7 from
@thornley_instantaneous_2002.

# A Multilayer Canopy Model

While Equations \@ref(eq:AnCanopy) and \@ref(eq:AnCanopyRefined) are useful for
defining $A_{n,canopy}$, they have limited practical value since they do not
have analytical solutions for detailed mechanistic models of leaf-level
photosynthesis. As [Thornley suggests](#thornley), a numerical integration
approach must be used to calculate canopy assimilation in this case. The
simplest approach to numerical integration is to approximate the integral by a
[Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum).

By dividing the cLAI interval $(0,L)$ into $N$ subintervals of equal size and
converting the integral to a Riemann sum, Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopyRefined)
becomes

\begin{equation}
    A_{n,canopy} = \sum_{i = 0}^{N-1} \left[
        A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}(\ell_i)f_{sunlit}(\ell_i) +
            A_{n,leaf}^{shaded}(\ell_i)f_{shaded}(\ell_i) \right]
                \cdot \frac{L}{N},
    (\#eq:AnCanopyMultilayer)
\end{equation}

where $\ell_i = (i + 0.5) \cdot L / N$ and $L / N$ is the cLAI subinterval
width. Here we have used the
["midpoint rule"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum#Riemann_summation_methods)
for the Riemann sum, but in principle the "left rule" or "right rule" could also
be used.

From a biological perspective, this approach to numerical integration can be
understood as dividing the crop canopy into $N$ thick layers of equal amounts of
leaf area. (Note that these layers are conceptually different than the
infinitesimally thin layers discussed in connection with Equation
\@ref(eq:AnCanopy).) Thus, Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopyMultilayer) is usually
referred to as a "multilayer canopy model." In this model, we assume that
$A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}$ for all sunlit leaves in a thick layer can be reasonably
approximated by $A_{n,leaf}^{sunlit}$ calculated for an infinitely thin layer
at the midpoint of that thick layer, and likewise for shaded leaves.

The accuracy of the multilayer canopy model expressed in Equation
\@ref(eq:AnCanopyMultilayer) will depend on how reasonable this assumption is.
Generally, the model will be more accurate when larger $N$ is used. As $N$
becomes larger, the width of each thick layer becomes smaller, and so
environmental conditions across each thick layer become more uniform. Of course,
if $N \rightarrow \infty$, the Riemann sum in Equation
\@ref(eq:AnCanopyMultilayer) converges back to the integral in Equation
\@ref(eq:AnCanopyRefined).

## Examples

Examples of multilayer canopy models can be found in the literature;
@bonan_moving_2021 contains references to many of them. Despite their
prevalence, descriptions of these models rarely contain an explicit equation
describing exactly how to relate canopy-level assimilation to leaf-level
assimilation, as we have done with Equation \@ref(eq:AnCanopyMultilayer).

For example, instead of providing an equation, @pury_simple_1997 write "Canopy
photosynthesis rate was calculated by the summation of the product of rate of
leaf photosynthesis per unit leaf area by the leaf area in each class" (page
541).

## Non-Multilayer Canopy Models

Note that if a different numerical integration technique such as Gaussian
quadrature is used instead of a Riemann sum, the canopy might not be divided
into layers; such a model would not be considered a multilayer canopy model
because it would not be conceptually divided into distinct thick layers
[@goudriaan_simple_1986; @goudriaan_light_2016].

# BioCro's Multilayer Canopy Model

In BioCro, we use the multilayer canopy model described in Chapter 15 of
@campbell_introduction_1998. Example 15.2 in that book is especially useful
for demonstrating how the model's equations should be used. However, note that
the example does not take a multilayer approach; instead, it only considers
sunlit and shaded leaves. Thus, some aspects of the example do not directly
apply for BioCro. For example, it is not necessary to calculate a weighted
average of diffuse PAR across the canopy in BioCro's model.

Here we summarize the main parts of the model as they are used in BioCro.

## Sunlit and Shaded Fractions

Equation 15.22 of @campbell_introduction_1998 calculates the fraction of sunlit
leaves:

\begin{equation}
    f_{sunlit}(\ell) = e^{-K_{direct} \cdot \ell},
\end{equation}

where $K_{direct}$ is the canopy extinction coefficient for direct radiation.
The shaded fraction is then given by $f_{shaded}(\ell) = 1 - f_{sunlit}$. The
extinction coefficient $K_{direct}$ depends on the leaf angle distribution and
the direction of incoming beam radiation (and hence the solar zenith angle). See
Equation 15.4 for more details.

## Incident Light

Within a canopy, several distinct types of light can be considered:

 * The beam flux just above the canopy $Q_{ob}$

 * The diffuse flux just above the canopy $Q_{od}$

 * The diffuse flux within the canopy $Q_d$

 * The down-scattered flux within the canopy $Q_{sc}$

 * The total beam flux (unintercepted beam and downscattered beam) within the
   canopy $Q_{bt}$

 * The unintercepted beam flux within the canopy $Q_b$

In general, there are broad distinctions between location (just above the canopy
or within the canopy), type (beam flux or diffuse flux), and source (flux from
the sky or flux that has been scattered by leaves in the canopy). Beam flux is
typically expressed as flux density through a horizontal plane, while diffuse
flux densities apply to any surface orientation because they are not
directional. Some of these fluxes are related to each other. In particular,
$Q_{bt} = Q_{sc} + Q_b$ (Equation 15.20).

Shaded leaves receive diffuse radiation and down-scattered radiation. Sunlit
leaves receive these types of radiation with the addition of direct beam
radiation. Expressed on a leaf area basis, the flux density incident on sunlit
and shaded leaves ($Q_{in}^{sunlit}$ and $Q_{in}^{shaded}$) are

\begin{equation}
    Q_{in}^{sunlit} = K_{direct} \cdot Q_{ob} + Q_d + Q_{sc}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
    Q_{in}^{shaded} = Q_d + Q_{sc}
\end{equation}

(Equations 15.18 and 15.19). The term $K_{direct} \cdot Q_{ob}$ is the average
direct beam radiation accounting for the distribution of leaf angles.

Solar diffuse radiation originates in the sky due to atmospheric scattering of
the sun's light and changes within the canopy according to

\begin{equation}
    Q_d(\ell) = Q_{od} \cdot e^{- \sqrt{\alpha} \cdot K_{diffuse} \cdot \ell},
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ absorptivity of the leaves in the canopy and $K_{diffuse}$ is the
extinction coefficient for diffuse radiation (see Figure 15.4 and surrounding
discussion). The factor $\sqrt{\alpha}$ models the effect of light scattering
and transmission by the leaves. This is Equation 15.17.

Additional diffuse radiation is caused by scattering and transmission of the
direct beam by the leaves. It can be calculated as the difference between the
total beam radiation and unintercepted beam radiation as follows:

\begin{equation}
    Q_{sc}(\ell) = Q_{bt}(\ell) - Q_b(\ell)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
    Q_{bt}(\ell) = Q_{ob} \cdot e^{- \sqrt{\alpha} \cdot K_{direct} \cdot \ell}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
    Q_b(\ell) = Q_{ob} \cdot e^{- K_{direct} \cdot \ell}.
\end{equation}

These are Equations 15.20, 15.15, and 15.16.

## Absorbed Shortwave Energy

Each leaf receives light spanning a wide range of wavelengths. Most light energy
is found in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and near-infrared
(NIR) bands (400 - 700 nm and 700 - 2500 nm, respectively).

The incident light energy in the PAR band can be estimated from the incident
PPFD by assuming a value for the average energy per PAR photon:

\begin{equation}
    I_{in}^{PAR} = Q_{in} \cdot E
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the average energy per PAR photon. Then the absorbed PAR energy can
be found using the equation for absorption by a thin layer, which simply
multiplies the incident radiation by the absorptivity:

\begin{equation}
    I_{abs}^{PAR} = \alpha_{PAR} \cdot I_{in}^{PAR}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{PAR} = 1 - T_{PAR} - R_{PAR}$ is the PAR absorptivity, and
$T_{PAR}$ and $R_{PAR}$ are the leaf transmittance and reflectance in the PAR
band, respectively.

In direct sunlight, the amount of energy in the NIR band can be estimated from
$I^{PAR}$ using a known fraction $f_{PAR}$:

\begin{equation}
    I^{NIR} = I^{PAR} \cdot (1 - f_{PAR}) / f_{PAR} (\#eq:NIRfromPAR)
\end{equation}

where $f_{PAR}$ is the fraction of shortwave energy in the PAR band. PAR and NIR
light are reflected and transmitted differently by leaves in the canopy, so this
fraction changes throughout the canopy. Rather than trying to predict
$f_{PAR}(\ell)$, we simply calculate $I_{in}^{NIR}$ just above the canopy top
using Equation \@ref(eq:NIRfromPAR), and then use the canopy light transmission
functions described above to calculate $I_{in}^{NIR}(\ell)$. Then, at each point
in the canopy, the total absorbed shortwave energy can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
    I_{abs}^{shortwave} = \alpha_{PAR} \cdot I_{in}^{PAR} +
        \alpha_{NIR} \cdot I_{in}^{NIR}
\end{equation}

# BioCro Examples

BioCro's ten layer canopy properties module can be used to calculate and plot
several of the variables discussed above. We use a solar zenith angle of 40
degrees, total canopy LAI of 3, total incident PPFD of 2000 (with 80 percent in
the beam) to match example 15.2 from the textbook. Other parameter values come
from Soybean-BioCro.

```{r}
library(BioCro)
library(lattice)

# Set inputs
zenith_angle  <- 40   # degrees
LAI           <- 3    # dimensionless
total_ppfd    <- 2000 # micromol / m^2 / s
beam_fraction <- 0.8  # dimensionless
windspeed     <- 2.0  # m / s

# Calculate total PAR energy just above the canopy
total_par <- total_ppfd * soybean$parameters$par_energy_content

# Run the ten-layer canopy properties module
canopy_properties <- evaluate_module(
    'BioCro:ten_layer_canopy_properties',
    within(soybean$parameters, {
        cosine_zenith_angle = cos(zenith_angle * pi / 180)
        lai = LAI
        par_incident_diffuse = total_par * (1 - beam_fraction)
        par_incident_direct = total_par * beam_fraction
        windspeed = windspeed
    })
)

# Make a helping function for extracting subsets of the results
canopy_profile <- function(basename, reslist) {
    vnames <- grep(
        paste0(basename, '_layer_[0-9]'),
        names(reslist),
        value = TRUE
    )
    as.numeric(reslist[vnames])
}

# Set the layer numbers
nlayer <- seq(0, 9)
```

First we can plot the fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves.

```{r}
# Plot sunlit and shaded fractions
f_sunlit <- canopy_profile('sunlit_fraction', canopy_properties)
f_shaded <- canopy_profile('shaded_fraction', canopy_properties)

xyplot(
    f_sunlit + f_shaded ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Fraction of leaves',
    ylim = c(0, 1)
)
```

Now we can plot incident PPFD for leaves within the canopy. Here `Q_above` is
the total incident PPFD just above the top of the canopy.

```{r}
# Plot incident light levels
Q_sunlit <- canopy_profile('sunlit_incident_ppfd', canopy_properties)
Q_shaded <- canopy_profile('shaded_incident_ppfd', canopy_properties)
Q_above  <- rep_len(total_ppfd, length(nlayer))

xyplot(
    Q_sunlit + Q_shaded + Q_above ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    cex = c(1, 1, 0),
    lty = c(1, 1, 2),
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Incident PPFD (micromol / m^2 / s)',
    ylim = c(0, 2100)
)
```

We can also plot absorbed shortwave energy for leaves within the canopy.

```{r}
# Plot absorbed shortwave energy
I_abs_sunlit <- canopy_profile('sunlit_absorbed_shortwave', canopy_properties)
I_abs_shaded <- canopy_profile('shaded_absorbed_shortwave', canopy_properties)

xyplot(
    I_abs_sunlit + I_abs_shaded ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Absorbed shortwave energy (J / m^2 / s)',
    ylim = c(0, 500)
)
```

We can also plot the fraction of absorbed shortwave energy in the PAR band
through the canopy.

```{r}
# Calculate absorptivity in the PAR band
absorptivity_par <- with(soybean$parameters, {1 - leaf_transmittance_par - leaf_reflectance_par})

# Calculate absorbed PAR energy
par_abs_sunlit <- Q_sunlit * soybean$parameters$par_energy_content * absorptivity_par
par_abs_shaded <- Q_shaded * soybean$parameters$par_energy_content * absorptivity_par

# Calculate the fraction of absorbed energy in the PAR band
sunlit_par_fraction <- par_abs_sunlit / I_abs_sunlit
shaded_par_fraction <- par_abs_shaded / I_abs_shaded

# Plot the fractions
xyplot(
    sunlit_par_fraction + shaded_par_fraction ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Fraction of absorbed light energy from PAR photons',
    ylim = c(0, 1)
)
```

Here we can see that although about half of solar light energy lies in the PAR
band, sunlit leaves absorb more PAR energy than NIR energy. Deeper within the
canopy, the fraction of absorbed light energy from PAR photons decreases.
Shaded leaves deep within the canopy may absorb more NIR than PAR energy.

As light levels vary within the canopy, leaf-level assimilation rates will also
vary. Here we can show this dependence by simulating light response curves at
a few different temperatures.

```{r}
# Simulate an A-Q curve
aq_curve <- module_response_curve(
    'BioCro:c3_assimilation',
    within(soybean$parameters, {
        StomataWS = 1
        gbw = 1.2
        rh = 0.6
    }),
    within(
        expand.grid(
            Tleaf = seq(15, 40, by = 5),
            Qabs = seq(0, total_ppfd * absorptivity_par, by = 5)
        ),
        {temp = Tleaf}
    )
)

# Include incident Q
aq_curve$Qin <- aq_curve$Qabs / absorptivity_par

# Plot it
xyplot(
    Assim ~ Qin,
    group = Tleaf,
    data = aq_curve,
    type = 'l',
    auto.key = list(space = 'right'),
    grid = TRUE,
    xlab = 'Qin (micromol / m^2 / s)',
    ylab = 'Leaf-level CO2 assimilation rate (micromol / m^2 / s)',
    ylim = c(-5, 30)
)
```

Finally, we can see how assimilation rates change throughout the canopy. Here
we will use an air temperature of 25 degrees C.

```{r}
# Get boundary layer conductance
gbw_canopy <- evaluate_module(
    'BioCro:canopy_gbw_thornley',
    c(soybean$parameters, list(
        canopy_height = LAI / soybean$parameters$heightf,
        windspeed = windspeed
    ))
)$gbw_canopy

# Get absorbed longwave energy
air_temperature <- 25

absorbed_longwave <- evaluate_module(
    'BioCro:stefan_boltzmann_longwave',
    list(temp = air_temperature, emissivity_sky = soybean$parameters$emissivity_sky)
)$absorbed_longwave

# Calculate canopy assimilation rates
canopy_assimilation <- evaluate_module(
    'BioCro:ten_layer_c3_canopy',
    within(c(soybean$parameters, canopy_properties), {
        StomataWS = 1
        rh = 0.6
        temp = air_temperature
        gbw_canopy = gbw_canopy
        absorbed_longwave = absorbed_longwave
    })
)

# Plot canopy assimilation rates
Assim_sunlit <- canopy_profile('sunlit_Assim', canopy_assimilation)
Assim_shaded <- canopy_profile('shaded_Assim', canopy_assimilation)

xyplot(
    Assim_sunlit + Assim_shaded ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Net CO2 assimilation rate (micromol / m^2 / s)',
    ylim = c(0, 25)
)
```

The canopy assimilation module also calculates other outputs such as leaf
temperature.

```{r}
# Plot canopy leaf temperatures
Tleaf_sunlit <- canopy_profile('sunlit_leaf_temperature', canopy_assimilation)
Tleaf_shaded <- canopy_profile('shaded_leaf_temperature', canopy_assimilation)

xyplot(
    Tleaf_sunlit + Tleaf_shaded ~ nlayer,
    type = 'b',
    pch = 16,
    auto.key = list(space = 'top'),
    xlab = 'Canopy layer',
    ylab = 'Leaf temperature (degrees C)'
)
```

We can also see the total canopy assimilation rate (in units of Mg / ha / hr):

```{r}
canopy_totals <- evaluate_module(
    'BioCro:ten_layer_canopy_integrator',
    within(c(canopy_properties, canopy_assimilation), {
        growth_respiration_fraction = 0
        lai = LAI
    })
)

canopy_totals$canopy_assimilation_rate
```

Another potentially interesting output is the total PPFD absorbed by the canopy.
We can check to make sure this is smaller than the incident PPFD just above the
canopy. This is not calculated by BioCro, so we will have to calculate it here.
We can define the total PPFD absorbed by the canopy to be

\begin{equation}
    Q_{abs,canopy} = \int_{\ell = 0}^{L} \left[
        Q_{abs,sunlit}(\ell) \cdot f_{sunlit}(\ell) +
            Q_{abs,shaded}(\ell) \cdot f_{shaded}(\ell) \right] d \ell.
\end{equation}

Taking a numeric approximation of the integral and using $Q_{abs} = \alpha
\cdot Q_{in}$, we can write the multilayer canopy version:

\begin{equation}
    Q_{abs,canopy} = \alpha \cdot \frac{L}{N} \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1} \left[
        Q_{in,sunlit}(\ell_i) \cdot f_{sunlit}(\ell_i) +
            Q_{in,shaded}(\ell_i) \cdot f_{shaded}(\ell_i) \right]
\end{equation}

This can be done in R as follows:

```{r}
Q_abs_canopy <-
    absorptivity_par * (LAI / 10) *
        sum(Q_sunlit * f_sunlit + Q_shaded * f_shaded)

Q_abs_canopy

Q_abs_canopy / total_ppfd
```

Section 10.1.2 (_Single-leaf photosynthesis_):

Section 10.2.1 (_Instantaneous canopy photosynthesis_):

Section 10.5 (_Discussion_):

> There will, of course, be situations where the level of approximation at the
> leaf photosynthesis level, or the description of light interception, is
> oversimplified. For example, we have not included the possibility of diurnal
> variation in the stomatal conductance (in response to factors such as leaf
> water potential or carbohydrate content) which may affect the rate of leaf
> photosynthesis. In such cases it will be necessary [to] use the general
> concepts developed here and evaluate the integrals - either through the depth
> of the canopy or throughout the day - numerically.
