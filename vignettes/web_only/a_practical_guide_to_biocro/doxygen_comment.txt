/**
 * This module implements the most basic model, which is discussed in many places,
 * e.g. section 2.7 of Campbell & Norman (1998). In this model, `DR` is determined
 * from the air temperature `T` according to:
 *
 * | DR           | T range       |
 * | :----------: | :-----------: |
 * | `0`          | `T <= T_base` |
 * | `T - T_base` | `T_base < T`  |
 *
 * Thermal time has units of `degrees C * day` and the development rate, as written
 * here, has units of `degrees C * day / day = degrees C`. This is a common formulation,
 * reflecting the fact that average daily temperatures are often used to calculate the
 * increase in thermal time during an entire day.
 *
 * This model is based on the observation that once the air temperature exceeds a
 * threshold, development begins to proceed linearly. However, it is known that this
 * trend cannot continue indefinitely and this model tends to overestimate development
 * at high temperatures.
