^.*\.Rproj$
# Designates the directory as an RStudio Project

^\.Rproj\.user$
# Used by RStudio for temporary files

^.*\.gz$
# If these files occur only as by-products of building vignettes, this
# could be made more specific: ^vignettes/.*\.gz

^ChangeLog$
# The latest entry in this file is from 2012.  This change log should
# probably be trashed and a new change log started per these
# guidelines: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.  Entries should
# correspond to package version releases.  And if the name
# ChangeLog.md is used, Markdown can be used for easy readability on
# GitHub.  See the PEcAn and BETYdb change logs for examples.

^TODO$
# Consider removing this file.  It's a remnant of BioCro 1 and is 8 years old.

^build\.sh$
# Consider removing this file or improving it.  It's a remnant of
# BioCro 1 and doesn't work properly on MacOS and maybe not at all on
# Windows.

^calibration\.RData$
# Not sure what this is.

^documentation$
# This is mostly for the Doxygen machinery but also includes some
# internal documentation for developers and contributers and
# documentation of some of the equations used in BioCro, together with
# publications containing these equations.  Documentation useful to
# users of the package should be moved to the vignettes directory.
# Publications that are readily available on-line should perhaps be
# removed from the package and referred to by their DOI.

^.*\.log$
# If these files occur only as by-products of building vignettes, this
# could be made more specific: ^vignettes/.*\.log

^tags$
# Not sure what produces these files.

^\.github$
# GitHub actions and workflows.

^src/.*\.o
^src/BioCro.so
# C++ build by-products.

^vignettes/.*\.aux
^vignettes/.*\.out
^vignettes/.*\.tex

# This file can possibly be eliminated.
