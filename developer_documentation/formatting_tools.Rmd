## Formatting Tools

### Clang's formatting tool

Many of these BioCro formatting preferences can be applied
automatically using the program [clang-format][] with the
[.clang-format][] file provided in the base directory of BioCro. **Do
not apply clang-format to all files indiscriminately**, as that will
ruin manually-aligned tables.

The best time to reformat a file is immediately before (or possibly
immediately after) making substantive changes to the code in the file.
But, as mentioned in the
["General Coding Considerations" section](#general-coding-considerations),
**sweeping formatting changes should be made in a separate commit**,
separate from any substantive changes made to the code.  This way,
changes to the functioning of the code won't be obscured by changes to
formatting that have no effect on code semantics.

#### Installation

One can install clang-format on Ubuntu using `sudo apt install
clang-format`.  On macOS, clang-format is available from the
[Homebrew][] package manager.

#### Using the Clang formatting tool

Files can be formatted using

```
clang-format file_name > new_file
```
or edited in place using
```
clang-format -i file_name
```

If your editor has the ability to display differences between the
original and revised versions of the file, it is a good idea to step
through and inspect the proposed changes to ensure they are desirable.

#### Using the Clang formatting tool with the CodeLite IDE

On Windows, macOS, or Linux, the CodeLite IDE includes clang-format
and provides an easy way to use it. First go to **Plugins -> Source
Code Formatter -> Options**. In the C++ tab, select `use .clang-format
file`. Now press `Ctrl-I` or click **Plugins -> Source Code Formatter
-> Format Current Source** to format a file.

### EditorConfig

Another tool to help with formatting is EditorConfig.  EditorConfig,
when used in conjunction with the [.editorconfig][] file provided in
the base directory of BioCro, provides a method for standardizing
settings across different text editors. While some editors have native
support, others require a plugin. See the [EditorConfig
website][EditorConfig] for more details.
