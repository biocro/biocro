<!-- footnotes -->

[^public-API]: As of this writing, no C++ API for BioCro has been
defined: there is no document that makes clear what publicly
accessible portions of the framework and standard library are
guaranteed to remain stable and available to be programmed against and
which portions are subject to change.

[^reproducibility]: Irrespective of what dependencies BioCro now has
or are added to it, a researcher who is concerned about reproducability
should consider making a containerized version of BioCro.  See, for
example, the chapter [Docker and Reproducibility] in the document for
the workshop [Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency].  The
BioCro maintainers don't provide containerized versions of BioCro as
we think this is a task better left to the individual researcher.

[^biocro_dependencies]: BioCro's strong dependencies are the R
framework, the C++ compiler used in installing the BioCro package, the
C++ Standard Library, the and the Boost C++ Library.

    As for R package dependencies, the BioCro R package depends only
upon packages in the R standard library (stats and utils) for its
basic installation and functioning.  BioCro does use other,
non-standard R packages for building the documentation and for
testing, but these are not essential to a fully-functioning BioCro
installation.

    For further reading on the benefits and pitfalls of using
dependencies, see, for example, Russ Cox's article [Our Software
Dependency Problem] and Bill Sourour's article [Code dependencies are
the devil].

[^compressing_vignettes]: If a package contains large vignette files,
`R CMD check` may produce an error about overly large documentation. In this
case, it can be helpful to specify `--compact-vignettes=both` when calling
`R CMD build`. Previously this was an important issue for BioCro, but it has
been mitigated by designating most vignettes as "web only."

## Making Changes

### Discuss first

* Check the list of [GitHub issues][] for a discussion of the
  issue. If there is not one, create an issue with a description of
  the problem and your proposed solution.

 By making changes without discussing it with the group, you risk
 spending time working on a solution that others may not accept. The
 members of the group also have diverse backgrounds and likely can
 give valuable design insights.

### Follow BioCro's git branching structure {#branch-structure}

* In general, BioCro development follows the [git-flow][] branching model, where
  there are two permanent branches (`main` and `develop`) and three types of
  temporary branches (hotfixes, features, and releases).

* For most contributors, it is only necessary to know that most changes should
  be accomplished through feature branches, which are branched off `develop` and
  merged back into `develop` via a pull request that must be approved by one or
  more other developers. The remainder of this section discusses our system in
  more detail.

* Beyond the basic description of git-flow, we have a few additional rules
  and clarifications specific to BioCro development:

  - Any merge into `main` or `develop` must be done via a pull request. This
    requirement is enforced with GitHub branch protection rules and cannot be
    bypassed.

  - All pull requests into `main` and `develop` require approval before merging.
    This requirement is not enforced using GitHub branch protection rules, but
    please do not unilaterally merge a pull request without any form of approval
    from another developer. (There are two exceptions to this rule related to
    hotfix and release branches, described below.)

  - The BioCro R package and repository follow semantic versioning of the form
    `major.minor.patch`. Hotfix branches should typically only increment the
    third (`patch`) number. Most release branches will increment the second
    (`minor`) number, and very rarely the first (`major`) number. Feature
    branches do not directly change the version number.

  - Hotfix and release branch names should be formatted like `type-version`,
    where `type` is either `hotfix` or `release`, and version is the new version
    number. For example, `hotfix-v3.0.3` would be a hotfix branch that
    changes the version number to `3.0.3`. Feature branch names should reflect
    their purpose, and can be anything other than `master`, `develop`,
    `hotfix-*`, or `release-*`.

  - Whenever the package version changes, a description of the related changes
    should be added to the changelog in `NEWS.md` as a new section titled with
    the new version number. Such version changes will happen via release and
    hotfix branches. Release branches will generally include changes made during
    the course of several feature branches, so they may require a significant
    amount of documentation in `NEWS.md`. To make it easier to prepare a list of
    these changes, each feature branch should include a description of its own
    changes in an `UNRELEASED` section of `NEWS.md`. For more information about
    updating the changelog, please see the comment at the top of `NEWS.md`.

* The following is a short description of BioCro's implementation of the
  git-flow branching model:

  - The `main` branch always contains the latest stable release of the BioCro
    GitHub repository. In fact, a new tag and release is made any time changes
    are merged into `main`, and such changes should always be accompanied by an
    increment to the BioCro R package version number.

  - The `develop` branch contains bug fixes and new features that have been
    completed but may not have been released yet.

  - Hotfix branches are for urgent changes that warrant immediate incorporation
    into `main`; typically these are bug fixes. A hotfix branch should be
    branched off `main`. When ready, it should first merged into `main` via an
    approved pull request. Then, a second pull request should be made to merge
    into `develop`. If there are no merge conflicts or test failures, this
    second request can be merged without any additional approval. When both
    merges are complete, the hotfix branch should be deleted.

  - Feature branches are for less urgent changes that do not require immediate
    release; for example, the addition of a new R function to the package
    namespace. A feature branch should be branched off `develop` and merged
    back into `develop` via an approved pull request. Before merging, `NEWS.md`
    should be updated with a description of the changes under the `# UNRELEASED`
    section (see `NEWS.md` for more details). When the merge into `develop` is
    complete, the feature branch should be deleted.

  - When sufficiently many changes have accumulated in `develop` to justify a
    new version of the package, a release branch is used to move the changes
    from `develop` to `main`. Release branches should not include substantive
    changes; rather, a release branch is primarily used to increment the package
    version and to ensure an up-to-date changelog in `NEWS.md`; see the
    ["New Release" chapter](#new-release) for more details. A release branch
    should be branched off `develop`. When it's ready, it should first merged
    into `develop` via an approved pull request. Then, a second pull request
    should be made to merge into `main`. (If the first PR target is `main`, it
    will be difficult to discern the minor changes in the release branch from
    the other changes in `develop`.) If there are no merge conflicts or test
    failures, this second request can be merged without any additional approval.
    When both merges are complete, the release branch should be deleted.

### Etiquette for pull requests {#pr-etiquette}

We have several conventions when making and reviewing pull requests that are
designed to make the process as efficient as possible, and to minimize any
issues introduced by new code. These have been used in many PRs and have been
found to be helpful.

* **Single ownership of each PR:** If multiple people are making changes to the
  same code, there is a potential for conflicting changes to occur. While git
  provides a way to resolve such conflicts, it is better to avoid causing them
  in the first place. A simple way to prevent most of these conflicts is to
  treat each branch and PR as having a single "owner" who is in charge of making
  all commits. There are a few consequences of this approach:

  - Pull request reviewers should suggest changes, not commit changes directly
    to the PR branch. If a reviewers wishes to contribute specific code changes,
    it is better to make them in a new branch and create a secondary PR to merge
    the changes into the original PR.

  - Pull request owners should either implement the suggested changes or give a
    short explanation for why they have chosen not to.

  - Once one or more reviewers have indicated their approval, it is the
    responsibility of the pull request owner to finalize the PR by merging it
    and deleting the branch.

* **Submitted code should work:** It takes time and effort to produce a
  thoughtful review of a pull request, so requests to review a PR should
  generally only be made for working code. In a BioCro context, "working" code
  means that `R CMD check` does not produce any errors and that all the
  vignettes can be built. See the ["Running R CMD check" chapter](#r-cmd-check)
  for more information. While this does not guarantee that the new code achieves
  its goals, is fully documented, or follows the coding style guidelines, it is
  nevertheless a minimum requirement for any code to be incorporated into
  BioCro. The following is a thorough workflow that should ensure submitted code
  is working:

  1. Run the regression tests locally. The tests don't take much time to run, so
     this is a good way to get fast feedback.

     Instructions for running the regression tests locally can be found in the
     ["Running the _testthat_ Tests" chapter](#running-testthat).

  2. When all the regression tests are passing, run `R CMD check` locally. This
     takes longer than just running the regression tests, but it will also make
     sure that all code in the examples (and some of the vignettes) is able to
     run, which sometimes turns up more issues.

     Instructions for running `R CMD check` locally can be found in
     ["Running R CMD check locally" section](#sec:local-r-cmd-check).

     Note that `R CMD check` will stop checking the examples once it encounters
     an error, so its list of problematic examples is not exhaustive. If there
     is an issue with an example, fix it and rerun `R CMD check` again because
     there may be additional errors in the examples.

  3. When `R CMD check` is passing locally, build _all_ the vignettes. Because
     of space limits imposed by CRAN, some of our vignettes are designated as
     "web only." Such vignettes are stored in the `vignettes/web_only` directoty
     and are not checked by `R CMD check`. They can be built manually on a
     case-by-case basis from within R by using `tools::build_vignette`, or all
     at once by running `pkgdown::build_site()` in an R session whose working
     directory is set to the root directory of the BioCro repository. See the
     ["Building package vignettes" section](#sec:building-vignettes) for more
     information.

  4. When `R CMD check` is passing locally and the vignettes can all be built
     locally, make a PR, but don't assign any reviewers. Making the PR will
     cause the workflow tests to run, which includes running `R CMD check` on
     several operating systems and versions of R, and building all the vignettes
     as part of the package documentation. This step takes the most time, but is
     important because sometimes an issue will appear that didn't occur locally
     on your own operating system or version of R.

  5. When the online checks have passed, then assign reviewers to begin the
     review process.

  Doing this will ensure that there are no basic issues when reviewers begin to
  look at the code. It may seem like a hassle, but it saves time in the long
  run. Even when the exact workflow above is not followed, the online tests can
  still be extremely helpful to a PR owner or reviewer:

  - It is possible to see whether the checks have passed by looking at the list
    of current PRs, where a red X next to a PR name indicates failure and a
    green check mark indicates success.

  - When the tests have failed, more details can be found in the "Checks" tab of
    the PR web site. This will include the exact error messages, which are the
    starting point for troubleshooting.

Of course, the conventions above are not hard rules, and there may be situations
where it is acceptable, or even necessary, to deviate from them. The following
is a (non-exhaustive) list of situations where these conventions could be
modified:

* A PR owner may give clear permission to another developer to make direct code
  changes. This may be in response to a reviewer asking to make changes.

* Sometimes the online tests will fail due to an issue with the testing setup
  itself. In that case it might not be necessary for them to pass. However, in
  this scenario, it is important for at least one developer to ensure that
  `R CMD check` passes locally.

* Although it is ideal to only submit working code, sometimes this is not
  possible for a variety of reasons. If you are working on new code and wish to
  discuss it but there are `R CMD check` errors, this can be accomplished via a
  PR, a draft PR, a GitHub issue, or a GitHub discussion. The best approach may
  vary with the particular situation. Regardless of which approach is taken, it
  is essential to acknowledge the `R CMD check` issue and be clear about the
  type of feedback or discussion you are requesting.

* Sometimes a working PR may begin failing `R CMD check` after the author has
  made code changes in response to reviewer feedback. This is normal; the new
  problems and their solutions will simply become part of the PR discussion.

### Making large modifications to BioCro

From time to time, someone will propose making a large change to the
organizational structure of BioCro or to one of its central
components. Here we also consider any modification that influences the
way users or developers interact with BioCro to be "large." Large
changes must be carefully considered and discussed before they are
implemented. When considering such proposals, a number of key points
should be kept in mind:

- BioCro is designed for computational modelers who want to focus on
  biology rather than computer programming; it is essential for BioCro
  to be easy to install and use.

  A friendly user experience makes BioCro accessible to a wide range
  of users who each have the potential to contribute to broader
  scientific understanding through modeling. Thus, it is important to
  minimize any barriers that may prevent some scientists from using
  it.

- BioCro is developed and maintained by a small team, most of whom
  have numerous other responsibilities. Thus, it is important to
  carefully consider the implementation and maintenance costs that may
  be associated with any proposed change, carefully weighing these
  against the perceived benefits.

- Changes to BioCro R packages should be consistent with [CRAN policies].

  Distributing BioCro via CRAN is a key part of keeping it accessible
  to all users with maximum ease.

- At its core, BioCro is a C++ library; the BioCro R package merely
  provides a convenient R interface. Even though this R interface
  exists, we wish the C++ core to remain usable on its own.

  This has two implications:

  + The core C++ library should maintain a consistent interface. Any
    changes to the public API should be carefully considered and
    carefully delineated.[^public-API]

  + It should be and should remain relatively painless to obtain and
    use this library without having to have a full R installation.

- With BioCro, a premium is put on keeping it relatively
  self-contained; needless dependencies should be avoided.

  There are a number of reasons for this:

  + Limiting dependencies will make it less likely BioCro will break
    for reasons beyond our control.

  + Limiting dependencies reduces security risks.  (On this point see,
    for example, Russ Cox's discussion of the 2017 Equifax fiasco in
    his article [Our Software Dependency Problem].)

  + Limiting dependencies makes reproducibilty easier.

    If one wishes to replicate results of a BioCro simulation, the
    task is more difficult if one has to worry not only about what
    platform, what version of R, and what version of BioCro were used
    to obtain the original results, but if, on top of that, one has to
    worry about the versions of other R packages depended
    upon.[^reproducibility]

  + Limiting dependencies means that fewer steps are required to
    install BioCro.

  BioCro has few dependencies, and all things being equal, we would
  like to keep it that way.[^biocro_dependencies]

If you propose a large modification to BioCro, please be prepared to
discuss the following questions:

1. How will time costs change for maintainers, developers, and users?

2. Will there be more or fewer opportunities for BioCro to break due
   to changes in its dependencies?

3. Which BioCro features will be added or lost?

### Releasing a new version of BioCro {#new-release}

When releasing a new version of BioCro, it is essential to make sure that
`NEWS.md` is up to date and that the new version is acceptable to CRAN. This can
be achieved through the following steps:

1. Choose the next version number; our conventions for semantic versioning are
   described in `NEWS.md`.

2. Make a new release branch whose name is formatted as `release-vX.Y.X`, where
   `X.Y.Z` is the new version number, as described in the
   ["Branching Structure" chapter](#branch-structure).

3. Update the `DESCRIPTION` file with the new release date (set to today's
   date), the new version number, and any necessary changes to the author list.

4. Change the `UNRELEASED` header in `NEWS.md` to the new version number, and
   check the contents of this section to ensure it is clear and complete. It may
   be helpful to look through the list of completed pull requests on GitHub to
   check for any important changes that may have been missed.

5. Run `R CMD check` to see any NOTEs that are reported; see the
   ["Running R CMD check chapter"](#r-cmd-check) for instructions. Check the
   contents of `cran-comments.md` to make sure it accurately reflects the
   `R CMD check` notes.

6. Make a pull request, requesting to merge the new branch into `develop`. In
   general, follow the guidelines in the
   ["Pull Request Etiquette" chapter](#pr-etiquette). However, there is one
   extra requirement for a release branch: the branch should not be merged until
   the new version has been accepted by CRAN. Sometimes CRAN may have issues
   with a new release, and it is better to address them _before_ finalizing the
   release. (Otherwise, there may be several releases in quick succession with
   only minor or trivial changes between them; for example, BioCro versions
   3.1.1 and 3.1.2.) See the ["Submitting to CRAN" chapter](#cran-submission)
   for instructions.

7. When the new version is on CRAN, merge the release branch into `develop` and
   then `main`.

### Submitting a new version of BioCro to CRAN {#cran-submission}

The package maintainer is responsible for submitting to CRAN, and the process
consists of the following steps:

1. Build the package with `R CMD build`[^compressing_vignettes] using the
   current release version.

2. Test the resulting `.tar.gz` file using `R CMD check --as-cran` using the
   current release version and the current development version on Linux and
   Windows. GitHub actions run this for R current Windows and Linux, and R
   devel Linux, so only R devel Windows needs to be checked locally.

3. Attach the resulting `.tar.gz` file to the form here:
   https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html.

4. Paste the contents of `cran-comments.md` in the form's comments box.

5. Submit, cross fingers, and wait. If any issues are found by CRAN, address
   them and try again. If the checks fail only from permissible NOTES, such as
   using C++11, reply to the email indicating the justification, for example,
   we use a library that uses C++11. You can restate what is in
   `cran-comments.md`.

BioCro's online testing system should catch most issues before reaching this
point, but sometimes CRAN starts enforcing rules that are not clearly explained
anywhere or not checked by `R CMD check`. The most up-to-date description of
CRAN's requirements can be obtained from the following official and
semi-official sources, which each offer a different perspective on CRAN
submission:

 - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

 - https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release

 - https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks

## Code style

(Most of what is discussed here pertains specifically to code for the BioCro C++
library.)

### Scientific considerations

#### Document sources and justifications in the code

* Include citations to sources for equations and parameters used in
  the code. The citation should be sufficient to locate the article
  and relevant information within it. Include a table or figure
  reference if appropriate.

* Use [Doxygen][doxygen manual]-style comment syntax for high-level
  documentation of functions and classes.  We use the Javadoc style of
  comment block in our code.  (See the documentation of the Solar
  Position module [`solar_position_michalsky`][Solar Position module]
  for an example of a Doxygen-style comment, and then look at [the way
  this is rendered in the generated documentation][Solar Position
  module rendering].)

* Include reasoning and justification for the model, including
  assumptions that determine when use of the model is appropriate.
  These descriptions should be succinct.

#### Document units in the code

* After every [physical quantity][], include a comment with the
  units. The idea is that every quantity will roughly be read as if it
  were written in normal text: for example, `double yield = 10 // Mg /
  ha` should be read as meaning "the yield was 10 Mg / ha". Using
  [dimensions][] instead of units is acceptable if the code is written
  with the expectation that [coherent units][] are used.

  The following example shows how to indicate units in a number of
  different contexts.  Note that, as in LaTeX, `^` is used to indicate
  a superscript, so that `m^2` indicates _square meters_.

    ```c++
    // In function signatures
    double ball_berry(double assimilation,                   // mol / m^2 / s
                      double atmospheric_co2_concentration,  // mol / mol
                      double atmospheric_relative_humidity,  // Pa / Pa
                      double beta0,                          // mol / m^2 / s
                      double beta1)                          // dimensionless from [mol / m^2 / s] / [mol / m^2 / s]

    // In assignments
    double leaf_temperature = air_temperature - delta_t;  // K.

    // In return statements
    return assimilation_rate;  // micromoles / m^2 / s.

    // In tables
    const std::map<SoilType, soilText_str> soil_parameters =
    {
        //                        d = dimensionless
        //                        d     d     d     J / kg      d     J s / m^3    d     d      d     Mg / m^3
        //                        silt  clay  sand  air_entry   b     Ks           satur fieldc wiltp bulk_density
        { SoilType::sand,       { 0.05, 0.03, 0.92,      -0.7,  1.7,  5.8e-3,      0.87, 0.09,  0.03, 1.60 } },
        { SoilType::loamy_sand, { 0.12, 0.07, 0.81,      -0.9,  2.1,  1.7e-3,      0.72, 0.13,  0.06, 1.55 } },
    };
    ```

* If you would like to include other details, include the units in the
  same way, and include details **following** the units so that the
  variables are still read like regular text.  For example, write

    ```c++
    ✓ return gswmol * 1000;  // mmol / m^2 / s. Convert from mol to mmol.
    ```

    _not_

    ```c++
    ✗ return gswmol * 1000;  // Converting from mol / m^2 / s to mmol / m^2 / s.
    ```

    Note that in a case such as this, the units apply to the entire
    value (`gswmol * 1000`) and not merely to the variable (`gswmol`).

* Use SI conventions for units and dimensions, including
  capitalization. Specifically, use "`degrees C`", not "`C`", to
  indicate &deg;C.

* Use full names when symbols are not available:
  * `micromoles / m^2`, _not_ `umol / m^2`
  * `degrees C`, _not_ ``*C``.

* Use `dimensionless` for dimensionless quantities, and include how
  the dimensions have canceled if that is informative.

* Use `^` to indicate exponentiation: `m^2`, _not_ `m2`.

* Prefer an asterisk to indicate multiplication; but indicating
  multiplication by juxtaposing units with exactly one space between
  them is acceptable. Prefer exactly one space on each side of the
  asterisk: `kg * m / s` or `kg m / s`.

* Either a solidus ("/") or negative exponent is acceptable to
  indicate division, but ensure that the solidus is used correctly if
  used multiple times. Prefer exactly one space on each side of the
  solidus.

#### Document parameters

* When adding models that require new parameters, document the
  parameters in the parameter table in [src/parameters.h][]. Please
  keep the table well formatted.

* If you are working on a model with undocumented parameters, it would
  be nice if you added them to the table as you work through the
  issue.

### General coding considerations
* Do not use C-style arrays. Use an appropriate data type from the standard
  library instead.

* Use cmath, not math.h, for common mathematical functions.

* Be careful with **using**-directives (e.g. `using namespace std`) in
  a global scope; do not use them in global scope in a header file.
  Try to make **using**-declarations (e.g. `using std::string`) as
  local as possible.  Type aliases (e.g. `using string_vector =
  std::vector<std::string>`) are perfectly acceptable in the global
  scope of a header file.

* Strongly prefer the [coherent][coherent units] set of SI
  units. Doing so reduces code complexity remarkably as no conversions
  are necessary. Yes, no one publishes values with these units, but do
  the conversion in one place, the manuscript, instead of dozens of
  times in the code, constantly having to look up units for variables,
  and then spending hours debugging silly, difficult-to-find errors.
  The coherent set of SI units consists of all the units without
  prefixes, except that kg is the coherent unit of mass, not g.

* Do not copy and paste code, changing only small parts. Choose a
  design that eliminates the duplication.

* Make an effort to write unit tests.  (See the vignette [_An
  Introduction to BioCro for Those Who Want to Add Models_][unit tests
  for modules] for information about writing unit tests—specifically,
  writing unit tests for new modules.)

* Do not mix sweeping formatting changes with behavior changes. Large
  formatting changes should be a separate commit, containing _only_
  formatting changes, and the commit comment should indicate that only
  formatting was changed.  This way, code that changes program
  behavior won't be obscured by a mass of changes to the formatting of
  the code.

* The Standard C++ Foundation's [C++ Core Guidelines][] have useful advice
  about [aspects of coding and design][].

### Formatting code

(Again, except in a few instances, this pertains specifically to C++ code.)

The most important aspect of formatting is that the code is easy to
understand. Below are unenforced preferences.

* Prefer `underscores_in_identifiers` not `CamelCaseInIdentifiers`
  and, in R, not `dots.in.identifiers`.  Prefer lowercase-only
  identifiers.  An exception may be made for commonly-recognized names
  used in a small scope, for example,

    ```c++
    I = V / R;
    F = m * a;
    E = m * (c * c);
    ```

* Avoid unnecessary parentheses. For example, use "`a * b / c`"
instead of <nobr>"`(a * b) / c`"</nobr> or <nobr>"`a * (b /
c)`"</nobr>.  But in cases where the order of operations affects the
result, parentheses may be used to erase any doubt in the mind of the
reader (or the programmer!) as to what that order is.  Thus, writing
`(a / b) * c` instead of (the equivalent) `a / b * c` is acceptable.
Parentheses may also be used to group portions of a formula that are
commonly considered as a sub-unit, where they provide some semantic
value (see the previous bullet point).  Consider naming parts of a
complicated expression in order to break it down into simpler ones.
For example,

    ```c++
    x = (-b + sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);
    ```

    may be rewritten in three lines as

    ```c++
    num = -b + sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c);
    denom = 2 * a;
    x = num / denom;
    ```

    Note that in C++, unlike in R, return statements do not require
    parentheses around the returned expression.

* Restrict the line length of paragraph-like comments to 80
  characters, excepting a compelling reason to do otherwise. Lines in
  sections that are not paragraph-like could be somewhat longer if it
  facilitates presenting material in a more readable format.  In the
  following snippet from the module library documentation, for
  example, we have allowed slighly-longer lines in order to be able to
  maintain one line per interval:

    ```c++
    /*
    *  However, this definition is flexible. For example, for our soybean model
    *  (soybean_development_rate_calculator.h) we define the intervals as follows:
    *  -1 <= DVI < 0 : Sowing to Emergence
    *   0 <= DVI < 1  :  Emergence to R1 (Flowering) is broken into three stages.
    *       0 <= DVI < 0.333        : Emergence to V0 (Cotyledon stage)
    *       0.333 <= DVI < 0.667    : V0 (Cotyledon stage) to R0 (End of Floral Induction)
    *       0.667 <= DVI < 1        : R0 (End of Floral Induction) to R1 (Flowering)
    *  1 <= DVI < 2 : R1 (Flowering) to R7 (Maturity)
    */
    ```

  As for the code lines themselves, we point to the following advice
  from the Linux kernel project:<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

  > The preferred limit on the length of a single line is 80 columns.

  > Statements longer than 80 columns should be broken into sensible
    chunks, unless exceeding 80 columns significantly increases
    readability and does not hide information.

* Do not include trailing whitespace, i.e., whitespace characters preceding
  newline characters.

* Each file should end with a newline character (i.e. a terminal endline).

* Use spaces rather than tab characters.

* In general, formatting preferences should follow something similar
  to the [Google C++ style guide][], except in cases where the code
  has been formatted in a more readable way, such as when aligning
  parts in a table.

* The Standard C++ Foundation guidelines offer some advice about
  [formatting conventions][aspects of coding and design] that are
  informative, particularly regarding the use of code comments.

For tools to help with formatting code, see the
["Formatting Tools" section](#formatting-tools).

### R-specific coding advice

* Prefer to use the double-bracket operator (`list[['element']]`) rather than
  the dollar-sign operator (`list$element`) when accessing the elements of a
  list. The `$` operator uses partial matching, whereas `[[`, by default, does
  not. (However, it can be specified: `list[['element', exact = FALSE]]`.)
  Avoiding partial matching by using `[[` gives us more confidence that errors
  won't occur.

* While there is no inherent performance difference between a `for`
  loop and an apply-type function such as `apply` or `lapply` (the
  apply functions actually use `for` loops in their source code), it
  is nevertheless possible to write a "bad" `for` loop that runs
  slowly. Common culprits include a failure to pre-allocate memory or
  a poor choice in assignment method. If a `for` loop seems to run
  slowly, consider replacing it with an apply-type function or
  tweaking the assignment method (e.g. replacing `append` with
  `[`). Many guides for optimizing loop performance are available
  online, such as [Strategies to Speedup R Code][] and [Why loops are
  slow in R][].

* Generally our R code follows the [Advanced R (1e) Style Guide][] with the
  exception of indentation, where we use 4 spaces rather than 2.

  * Put a space after control statements (such as `if` or `for`), but do not
    put a space after other function names (such as `function`, `return`, or
    `sqrt`). For example:

    ```R
    myfun <- function(x) {
        y <- if (x == 1) {
            2
        } else {
            sqrt(x)
        }

        return(y)
    }
    ```

    (Yes, in R, `function` is a function.)

<b id="f1">1</b> The Linux kernel project recently changed the default
length for code lines from 80 to 100 characters with the following
commit comment:

> Yes, staying withing 80 columns is certainly still _preferred_.  But
it's not the hard limit that the checkpatch warnings imply, and other
concerns can most certainly dominate.

> Increase the default limit to 100 characters.  Not because 100
characters is some hard limit either, but that's certainly a "what are
you doing" kind of value and less likely to be about the occasional
slightly longer lines. [↩](#a1)
