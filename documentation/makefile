define HELPTEXT

Useful targets:

default:   Generate the HTML documentation for all files in src.  This is what
           you get if you just type "make" in the documentation directory.

all:       Generate both the HTML and the PDF documentation for all files in
           the src and src/module_library directories.

all-html:  Generate the HTML documentation for all files in the src and
           src/module_library directories.

all-pdf:   Generate the PDF documentation for all files in the src and
           src/module_library directories.

view:      View the HTML documentation (first generating it if needed)
           produced by the default target.

view-all:  View the HTML documentation (first generating it if needed) that
           includes documentation of the code in the src/module_library
           directory.

view-pdf:  View the PDF documentation, first generating it if needed.

clean:     Remove the html directory and its contents, preparing the way for a
           fresh default build.

clean-all: Remove the "complete" directory and its contents, preparing the way
           for a fresh build of the "all" target.
