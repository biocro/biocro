<!-- external references -->

<!-- External references used by more than one bookdown source file
     should be placed here rather than in each of the files where
     used.  This will prevent "Duplicate link reference" warnings.

     Background: Because the "Knit and Merge" (K-M) strategy (see
     https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/new-session.html) does not
     allow Rmd files to be in subdirectories, we must use the "Merge
     and Knit" (M-K) strategy when rendering the book.  This means
     that all of the Markdown code will be merged into one file before
     processing so that the files are not treated independently.  In
     particular, if the same link reference name is used in multiple
     files, this will trigger a warning.  -->

# Introduction {-}

The documentation in this short book is aimed at developersâ€”at those
who will be writing new modules or modifying existing ones; and most
especially at those fixing bugs in or adding new features to the
BioCro simulation framework, and those involved with the overall
maintenance of the BioCro package.
