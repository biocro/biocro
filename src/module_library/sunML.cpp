 *  @brief Computes absorbed light from incident light for a thin layer of

 *  Suppose light of intensity `I_0` (representing a flux density of photons or
 *  energy, expressed in units of photons per area per time, or energy per area
 *  per time) is incident on a thin layer of a material that reflects, absorbs,
 *  and transmits light. If `R` and `T` represent the fractions of light
 *  reflected by and transmitted through the layer, then we can calculate the
 *  light absorbed by the layer (`I_abs`) as follows:
 *
 *  `I_abs = I_0 * (1 - R - T)`     [Equation (1)]
 *
 *  In this equation, the factor `(1 - R - T)` represents the fraction of light
 *  absorbed by the layer. In BioCro, this equation is often used to calculate
 *  the light absorbed by a leaf or a thin layer of leaf material.
 *
 *  @param [in] R The fractional amount of light reflected by a thin layer of

 *  @param [in] T The fractional amount of light transmitted by a thin layer of
