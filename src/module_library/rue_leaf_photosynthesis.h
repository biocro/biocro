 *
 *  @brief  Calculates leaf photosynthesis parameters using a simple radiation
 *  use efficiency (RUE) model where gross CO2 assimilation is assumed to be
 *  directly proportional to the incident photosynthetically active photon flux
 *  density (PPFD).
 *
 *  ### General overview of RUE models
 *
 *  The general RUE concept is based on the empirical observation that a measure
 *  of plant growth is often found to be directly proportional to a measure of
 *  light exposure. There are three distinct factors involved in a RUE model:
 *
 *  - The measure of growth, which can be the net CO2 uptake by the above-ground
 *    portions of the canopy, total above-ground dry matter, total plant dry
 *    matter including roots, etc.
 *
 *  - The measure of light exposure, which can be intercepted solar radiation,
 *    absorbed solar radiation, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation,
 *    etc.
 *
 *  - The time scale over which RUE is evaluated, where growth and light
 *    exposure can be evaluated instantaneously or integrated at an hourly,
 *    daily, weekly, seasonal, or annual basis.
 *
 *  Thus, it is better to think of RUE as a family of models rather than a
 *  single model. See Arkebauer et al. (1994) for more discussion about the
 *  variability of RUE models. Besides the difficulties associated with
 *  comparing RUE proportionality constants that have been determined using
 *  different options for the measures of growth, light exposure, and time,
 *  several other problems associated with RUE models have been noted in the
 *  literature:
 *
 *  - RUE models mix cause and effect to some degree because a larger canopy
 *    intercepts more light simply due to its size; in fact, it is possible to
 *    define a RUE coefficient for non-photosynthesizing organisms such as
 *    chickens (Demetriades-Shah et al. (1992)).
 *
 *  - When RUE is evaluated over a longer time scale such as hours or days,
 *    the apparent proportionality between growth and light interception may be
 *    an artifact of integration; in fact, it is possible to find a linear
 *    relationship between accumulated `X` and accumulated `Y` even if `X` and
 *    `Y` take random values (Demetriades-Shah et al. (1992)).
 *
 *  - RUE must be recharacterized for different crops, locations, years, and
 *    other environmental values, giving it limited predictive power in
 *    situations outside of experience. A crucial shortcoming is its inability
 *    to predict changes in crop photosynthesis that would result from increases
 *    in atmospheric [CO2] (Humphries and Long (1995)).
 *
 *  This model is included in BioCro primarily to highlight the importance of
 *  using mechanistic photosynthesis models and should be avoided in
 *  non-pedagogical situations.
 *
 *  ### This particular RUE model
 *
 *  Here we use a RUE model where the measure of growth is the leaf-level gross
 *  CO2 assimilation rate (`A_g`) and the measure of light exposure is the
 *  amount of PPFD intercepted by the leaf (`Q`). Both of these quantities are
 *  considered to be instantaneous rates, and the equation relating them is
 *
 *  > `A_g = alpha_rue * Q` (1)
 *
 *  BioCro uses units of micromol / m^2 / s for both `A_g` and `Q`, so the
 *  proportionality constant `alpha_rue` is dimensionless. Alternatively, it can
 *  be considered to have units of C / photon.
 *
 *  Equation (1) was chosen so that this RUE model could be as close as possible
 *  to the more realistic versions in `c3_leaf_photosynthesis` and
 *  `c4_leaf_photosynthesis`, using the following rationale:
 *
 *  - The model should calculate an instantaneous CO2 assimilation rate so it
 *    can be used in place of the other options inside a multi-layered canopy,
 *    allowing the user to switch between RUE and mechanistic models with as few
 *    other changes as possible.
 *
 *  - It makes more sense to use `A_g` than the net CO2 assimilation rate `A_n`
 *    because `A_n` is generally negative when `Q` is zero due to respiration,
 *    a situation that a RUE model with `A_n = alpha_rue * Q` would not be able
 *    to reproduce.
 *
 *  Unlike the C3 and C4 versions of leaf photosynthesis, no attempt was made to
 *  modify `A_n` according to water stress, as this would not be included in a
 *  pure RUE model. (However, in principle, the value of `alpha_rue` could be
 *  modified according to water stress or other factors by a hypothetical
 *  associated module.) In all other respects besides the calculations for
 *  `A_g` and the lack of water stress, this module is the same as the
 *  `c3_leaf_photosynthesis` module:
 *
 *  - It uses the same equation to calculate day respiration from leaf
 *    temperature.
 *
 *  - It uses the Ball-Berry model to calculate stomatal conductance from `A_n`.
 *
 *  - It uses the `c3EvapoTrans()` function to handle transpiration and
 *    determine leaf temperature.
 *
 *  However, it is important to note that assimilation and stomatal conductance
 *  are not determined iteratively since stomatal conductance has no impact on
 *  assimilation, in contrast to the C3 and C4 cases (described by `c3photoC()`
 *  and `c4photoC()` functions, respectively).
