 * Computation of the cosine of the zenith angle from latitute (`lat`), day of
 * the year (`DOY`), and time of day (`td`).
 *
 * For the values of angles in radians, we'll use the common practice of
 * denoting the latitude by `phi` (\f$\phi\f$), the declination by `delta`
 * (\f$\delta\f$), and the hour angle by `tau` (\f$\tau\f$).  `NDS` denotes the
 * number of days after December solstice and `omega` (\f$\omega\f$) denotes the
 * angle (in radians) of the orbital position of the earth around the sun
 * relative to its position at the December solstice.
 *
 * Denoting the axial tilt of the earth by \f$\varepsilon\f$, the equation used
 * for declination (`delta`) is
 * \f[
 *     \delta = -\varepsilon \cos(\omega)
 * \f]
 * which is an approximation (always accurate to within 0.26 degrees) of the
 * more accurate formula
 * \f[
 *     \sin(\delta) = -\sin(\varepsilon) \cos(\omega)
 * \f]
 *
 * The cosine of the solar zenith angle \f$\theta_s\f$ may be calculated from
 * the declination \f$\delta\f$, the latitude \f$\phi\f$, and the hour angle
 * \f$\tau\f$ by the formula
 * \f[
 *     \cos(\theta_s) = \sin(\delta) \sin(\phi) + \cos(\delta) \cos(\phi) \cos(\tau)
 * \f]
 * which is a straight-forward application of the law of cosines for spherical
 * triangles, substituting cofunctions of coangles in the case of latitude and
 * declination.

/**
 * @brief Calculates a relative humidity profile throughout a multilayer
 * canopy.
 *
 * @param[in] RH relative humidity just above the canopy `(0 <= RH <= 1)`
 *
 * @param[in] nlayers number of layers in the canopy `(1 <= nlayers <= MAXLAY)`
 *
 * @param[out] relative_humidity_profile array of relative humidity values
 * expressed as fractions between 0 and 1, where the value at index `i`
 * represents relative humidity at the bottom of canopy layer `i` and `i = 0`
 * corresponds to the top canopy layer.
 *
 * One can derive an expression for the relative humidity (`h`) throughout a
 * plant canopy by making the following assumptions:
 * - `h` at the top of the canopy is the same as the ambient value (`h = h0`)
 * - `h` at the bottom of the canopy is one hundred percent (`h = 1`)
 * - `h` follows an exponential profile throughout the canopy
 *
 * To enforce the exponential profile, we can write
 *
 * `h(x) = A * exp(B * x)`              [Equation (1)]
 *
 * where `x` is a normalized expression of depth within the canopy (`x = 0` at
 * the canopy top and `x = 1` at the bottom) and the values of `A` and `B` are
 * yet to be determined.
 *
 * To enforce the `h` value at the canopy top, we require `h0 = h(0) = A`; in
 * other words, `A = h0`. To enforce the `h` value at the canopy bottom, we
 * require `1 = h(1) = h0 * exp(B)`; in other words, `B = -ln(h0)`. Putting it
 * all together, we see that under these assumptions, `h` throughout the canopy
 * is given by
 *
 * `h(x) = h0 * exp(-ln(h0) * x)`       [Equation (2)]
 *
 * If we additionally assume that `h0` is close to 1, we can simplify
 * `B = -ln(h0)` by taking just the linear part of the Taylor series for
 * `-ln(h0)` centered at `h0 = 1`, which is `B = -(h0 - 1)`. With this
 * modification, we have
 *
 * `h(x) = h0 * exp((1 - h0) * x)`      [Equation (3)]
 *
 * When `h0 = 1`, Equations (2) and (3) are in perfect agreement, reducing to
 * `h(x) = 1`. However, as `h0` deviates further from `h0 = 1`, the
 * linearization for `B` becomes less accurate and the two versions diverge,
 * especially deeper in the canopy. For example, when `h0 = 0.7`, Equation (2)
 * becomes `h(x) = 0.7 * exp(0.357 * x)` while Equation (3) becomes
 * `h(x) = 0.7 * exp(0.300 * x)`. Both versions agree at the top of the canopy
 * where `x = 0` and `h(x) = 1`, but are different at the bottom: 1.00 vs. 0.94.
 * For lower `h0` values, the difference at the canopy bottom becomes even more
 * pronounced, significantly violating one of the original assumptions. However,
 * there isn't a strong scientific justification for assuming humidity is 1 at
 * the bottom of *every* canopy, so the error due to the approximation for `B`
 * is deemed to be acceptable.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * In BioCro, we divide the canopy into equally sized layers; i.e., the interval
 * `0 <= x <= 1` is divided into `n` segments of length `1 / n` by `n + 1`
 * boundaries occurring at `x = 0`, `x = 1 / n`, `x = 2 / n`, ..., `x = 1`. Here
 * we wish to find the `h` value at the bottom of each layer, so we use Equation
 * (3) with `x = 1 / n`, `x = 2 / n`, ..., `x = 1`.
 *
 * In the code below, the `RH` input argument corresponds to `h0`, the
 * exponential growth constant `kh` corresponds to `B`, and `nlayers`
 * corresponds to `n`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Note 1: the explanation for this code was "reverse engineered" by EBL from
 * some crytpic documentation found in earlier versions of this function and
 * from Stephen Humphries's thesis, which is not available online:
 *
 * Humphries, S. "Will mechanistically rich models provide us with new insights
 * into the response of plant production to climate change?: development and
 * experiments with WIMOVAC: (Windows Intuitive Model of Vegetation response
 * to Atmosphere & Climate Change)" (University of Essex, 2002).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Note 2: Equation (2) can be rewritten by noting that `h0 = exp(ln(h0))`. With
 * this replacement, the equation becomes
 *
 * `h(x) = exp(ln(h0) - ln(h0) * x) = exp(-B * (1 - x))`
 *
 * The equation takes this form in Humphries's thesis.

/**
 *  @brief Subtracts respiratory losses from a carbon production rate
 *
 *  @param [in] base_rate The base rate of carbon production that does not
 *                        include respiratory losses. Any units are acceptable,
 *                        e.g. mol / m^2 / s or Mg / ha / hour.
 *
 *  @param [in] mrc Maintenance respiration coefficient (dimensionless)
 *
 *  @param [in] temp Temperature (degrees C)
 *
 *  @return A modified rate having the same units as `base_rate` where
 *          respiratory losses have been subtracted
 *
 *  ### Model overview
 *
 *  The idea here is that the net carbon assimilation rate (`A_n`) is given by
 *
 *  > `A_n = A_g - R` (1)
 *
 *  where `A_g` is the gross assimilation rate or the production rate and `R` is
 *  the respiration rate. A further assumption is that respiration is
 *  proportional to production, i.e.
 *
 *  > `R = R_c * A_g` (2)
 *
 *  where `R_c` is a dimensionless coefficient that lies on the interval [0,1].
 *  Combining equations (1) and (2), we can express the net assimilation rate
 *  as a function of the gross assimilation rate and the respiration
 *  coefficient:
 *
 *  > `A_n = A_g - R_c * A_g =  A_g * (1 - R_c)` (3)
 *
 *  In this function, the temperature dependence of the respiration coefficient
 *  is modeled using a simple "Q10" method where `Q10 = 2` and the base
 *  temperature is 0 degrees C, i.e.,
 *
 *  > `R_c = R_c_0 * 2^(T / 10)` (4)
 *
 *  where `T` is the temperature in Celsius. Combining equations (3) and (4), we
 *  finally arrive at a relationship between net assimilation, gross
 *  assimilation, and temperature:
 *
 *  > `A_n = A_g * (1 - R_c_0 * 2^(T / 10))` (5)
 *
 *  In the code below, `base_rate` represents the gross assimilation rate `A_g`,
 *  `mrc` represents the maintenance respiration coefficient `R_c_0`, and `temp`
 *  represents the temperature `T`.
 *
 *  ### Sources
 *
 *  In Stephen Humphries's thesis, he describes the respiration model in the
 *  following way: "The respiration model of McCree (1970) modified according to
 *  Penning de Vries (1972) and Thornley (1970) is used here to predict plant
 *  respiration... The respiration associated with each plant structure is
 *  modified according to the temperature of the structure using a Q10
 *  approximation with a value of 2 as described by Spain and Keen (1992)."
 *
 *  I (EBL) believe these references to be to the following documents:
 *
 *  - [de Vries, F. P. "Respiration and growth" in "Crop processes in controlled
 *    environments" 327–347 (Academic Press, 1972)]
 *    (https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/218533)
 *
 *  - [Thornley, J. H. M. "Respiration, Growth and Maintenance in Plants" Nature
 *    227, 304–305 (1970)](https://doi.org/10.1038/227304b0)
 *
 *  - McCree, K. "An equation for the rate of respiration of whiteclover plants
 *    grown under controlled conditions" in: "Prediction and measurement
 *    of photosynthetic productivity" Wageningen: Centre for Agricultural
 *    Publishing and Documentation, 221-229 (1970)
 *
 *  - Keen, R. E. & Spain, J. D. "Computer simulation in biology. A BASIC
 *    introduction" (1992)
 *
 *  I believe the McCree, Thornley, and de Vries papers describe the
 *  relationship between gross assimilation and respiration, while the Keen &
 *  Spain book describes the temperature dependence. Unfortunately, I can't find
 *  an online version of that book so I can't be sure.
 *
 *  For some general discussions about respiration, see the following two
 *  sources:
