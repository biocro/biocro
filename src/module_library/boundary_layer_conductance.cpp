 *  @brief Calculates the conductance for water vapor flow from the leaf across
 *  its boundary layer using a model described in Nikolov, Massman, and
 *  Schoettle (1995).
 *
 *  Note that for an isolated leaf, this conductance characterizes the entire
 *  path from the leaf surface to the ambient air. For a leaf within a canopy,
 *  there is an additional boundary layer separating the canopy from the
 *  atmosphere; this canopy boundary layer conductance must be calculated using
 *  a separate model.
 *
 *  In this model, two types of gas flow are considered: "forced" flow driven
 *  by wind-created eddy currents and "free" flow driven by temperature-related
 *  buoyancy effects. The overall conductance is determined to be the larger of
 *  the free and forced conductances.
 *
 *  In this function, we use equations 29, 33, 34, and 35 to calculate boundary
 *  layer conductance. This is the same approach taken in the `MLcan` model of
 *  Drewry et al. (2010).
 *
 *  In this model, the minimum possible boundary layer conductance that could
 *  occur is zero. This would happen if wind speed is zero and the air and leaf
 *  temperatures are the same. In realistic field conditions, boundary layer
 *  conductance can never truly be zero. To accomodate this, an option is
 *  provided for setting a minimum value for the boundary layer counductance.

 *  @brief Calculates the conductance for water vapor flow from the canopy
 *  across its boundary layer using a model described in Thornley and Johnson
 *  (1990).
 *
 *  Note that when gas exchange is considered at the canopy level, this
 *  conductance characterizes the entire path to the ambient air. For a leaf
 *  within a canopy, there is an additional boundary layer separating the leaf
 *  from the canopy boundary layer; this leaf boundary layer conductance must be
 *  calculated using a separate model.
 *
 *  This model considers gas flow due to wind-driven eddy currents. Here, the
 *  conductance is calculated using Equation 14.9 from pages 414 - 416 of the
 *  Thornley textbook. Unfortunately, an electronic version of this reference is
 *  not available.
 *
 *  In this model, the minimum possible boundary layer conductance that could
 *  occur is zero, which would correspond to zero wind speed or canopy height.
 *  In realistic field conditions, boundary layer conductance can never truly be
 *  zero because of other transport processes such as buoyancy effects. To
 *  accomodate this, an option is provided for setting a minimum value for the
 *  boundary layer counductance.
 *
 *  This model contains two singularities, which occur when either of the
 *  following conditions are met:
 *
 *  - `WindSpeedHeight + Zeta - d = 0`, which is equivalent to `CanopyHeight =
 *     WindSpeedHeight / (dCoef - ZetaCoef) = WindSpeedHeight * 1.34`
 *
 *  - `WindSpeedHeight + ZetaM - d = 0`, which is equivalent to `CanopyHeight =
 *     WindSpeedHeight / (dCoef - ZetaMCoef) = WindSpeedHeight * 1.56`
 *
 *  So, as the canopy height approaches or exceeds the height at which wind
 *  speed was measured, the calculated boundary layer conductance becomes
 *  unbounded. For even larger canopy heights, the conductance eventually begins
 *  to decrease. For tall crops, this is a severe limitation to this model. Here
 *  we address this issue by limiting the canopy height to
 *  `0.98 * WindSpeedHeight`.
