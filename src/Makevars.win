# Ideally, there would be one Makevars file for all systems. However, at the time
# of writing, the version of GNU make included with Rtools does not support
# order-only dependencies, which is needed to sensibly create the .deps and
# .deps/module_library directories. Thus, this Makevars file creates those
# directories every time the .d files are built, which on Windows has
# no effect if the directories already exist. 
#
# If the version of make included with Rtools is updated to version 3.80 or later,
# then the file will likely be unnecessary.

# The code below is a slightly modified version of the method for generating and
# using dependency files presented at
# http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation/#combine
#
# Modifications include:
#
# 1. Ensuring "all" is the default target.
# 2. Setting a value for OUTPUT_OPTION (presumably needed, but not discussed in
#    the paper).
# 3. Replacing ".c" extensions with ".cpp".
# 4. Defining COMPILE.cpp to use compiler and flag variables more closely
#    matching what is given in the suffix rule for .cpp.o contained in the
#    Makeconf file.
# 5. Since this file is read in before Makeconf, we can't cancel the suffix rule
#    listed there for making %.o files from %.cpp files by using the recipe-less
#    rule "%.o : %.cpp", so we make our new rule for this into a static pattern
#    rule, which automatically gives it higher priority.
# 6. Modifying the recipe for making the directories that contain the dependency
#    files so that the subdirectory module_library is also made.
# 7. Changing the variable name SRCS to SOURCES to match what the
#    previously-existing version of this file used.
