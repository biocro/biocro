## This tests that re-running a previously-run simulation yields the same result
## as before.
##
## If any of the crop-specific defaults for the initial state, parameters,
## modules or weather data change, or if the behavior of any of these modules
## changes, the stored data for one or more crops will likely need to be
## updated. To do this, open a fresh R session in this directory, load the
## `BioCro` and `testthat` libraries, source this file, and type the following
## command:
##
## update_stored_results(PLANT_TESTING_INFO[[INDEX]])
##
## where the value of `INDEX` corresponds to the desired crop as defined in the
## `PLANT_TESTING_INFO` list below. For example, INDEX = 1 corresponds to
## Miscanthus. Afterwards, check the git diff for the stored data files to make
## sure the changes are reasonable (to the extent that this is possible).
## Finally, rerun this file using the `testthat` package to make sure the tests
## all pass.
