## Bugs: The tests may fail for large values of ω (that is, when the spring
## constant is very large compared to the mass).  This might be remedied by
## screening out these cases as not suitable for the model or possibly by
## adjusting the error tolerance in such cases.

## Equations for the position x and velocity v of an undamped oscillating mass are
##
##   x =  A sin(ωt + φ)
##   v = ωA cos(ωt + φ)
##
## where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase.
##
## A, φ, and ω may in turn be computed from the mass m, the spring constant k, the
## initial position x0, and the initial velocity v0 using the equations
##
##   A = sqrt(x0^2 + m/k * v0^2)
##   φ = arctan(x0 * ω / v0)      (if v0 > 0)
##     = arctan(x0 * ω / v0) + π  (if v0 < 0)
##     = π/2                      (if v0 = 0 and x0 > 0)
##     = -π/2                     (if v0 = 0 and x0 < 0)
##   ω = sqrt(k/m)
##
## Note that φ is undefined if both x0 and v0 are zero, but in this case A will
## also be zero, so the value of φ is immaterial and may be arbitrarily assigned
## a value of zero.  m and k are assumed to be non-zero.
##
## The total energy of the system is constant over time and is given by
##
##   E = 1/2 * kA^2
##
##
## A note on units
##
## In the equations above, we assume a consistent set of units so that no
## conversion factors are required.  Moreover, φ is assumed to be in radians and
## ω in radians per unit time.
##
## Although it is a goal of BioCro to work exclusively in SI units, currently,
## the base time unit for BioCro is always an hour.  This means that even if we
## choose meters for the unit of length and kilogram for the unit of mass, the
## derived units in which the quantities v (velocity), k (the spring constant),
## and E (the system energy) will not be expressed in SI units.  v, for example,
## will be in meters per hour, and k will be in kilograms per hour squared, or
## in other words, a unit equivalent to 7.716 x 10^-8 newtons per meter.  E will
## be in units of kilogram-meters squared per hour squared, a unit equivalent to
## 7.716 x 10^-8 joules.
