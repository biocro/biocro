## BioCro [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev.svg?token=tjzJV6N6JPssJ6yfYPqH&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/ebimodeling/biocro-dev)
BioCro is a model that predicts plant growth over time given crop-specific parameters and environmental data as input.

It uses models of key physiological and biophysical processes underlying plant growth ([Humphries and Long, 1995]), and has previously been used for predicting biomass yield and leaf area index of switchgrass and miscanthus ([Miguez et al., 2009]).

BioCro has also been integrated into a suite of tools that link the model directly to crop trait and yield data ([LeBauer et al., 2014]). The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer ([PEcAn](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan)) couples BioCro to the [Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database](https://www.betydb.org). 

### An example
The Gro() function accepts initial values, parameters, climate variables, and a set of modules to run. It returns the results in a data frame.

```r
library(BioCro)
library(lattice)

result = Gro(sorghum_initial_state, sorghum_parameters, get_growing_season_climate(weather05), sorghum_modules)
xyplot(Stem + Leaf ~ TTc, result, type='l')
```

There are parameters and modules for miscanthus (_Miscanthus_ x _giganteus_), sorghum (_Sorghum bicolor_) and willow (_Saliceae salix_).


### Installation
#### Requirements
- The [R environment](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 3.2.3 or greater.
- On Windows, [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) version 3.3 or higher (3.5 is not recommended as of 2019-12-05 since that version is not frozen).
- On Linux, gcc and g++ version 4.9.3 or greater (consult documentation for your distribution for installation instructions).
- On MacOS, Xcode.

#### Installation steps
Download the BioCro source code from GitHub, unzip the file, and install from the either the command line or from within R using one of the following sets of commands. 

Do one of the sets of instruction below. These assume that the source files are in a directory named "biocro".

- From the command line
```
cd path_to_unzipped_directory
R CMD INSTALL biocro
```

- Or from within R
```
setwd('path_to_unzipped_directory')
install.packages('biocro', repos=NULL, type='SOURCE')
```
